# Back-End Development with .NET - Course Notes

Welcome to my Notion workspace where I document my learnings from the [Back-End Development with .NET](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-development-with-dotnet) course by Microsoft on Coursera. This section is organized to provide a structured overview of each module, along with code snippets, key concepts, and personal reflections.

## ðŸ“Œ Course Overview

This course teaches back-end development using ASP.NET Core, covering topics such as building Web APIs, handling data serialization, middleware, dependency injection, and error handling with logging. The course is structured to help you build scalable and maintainable back-end applications in .NET.

## ðŸ“Œ Daily Progress

Each day, I document:

- Code implementations and solutions.
- Challenges faced and how I overcame them.
- Insights and key takeaways.
